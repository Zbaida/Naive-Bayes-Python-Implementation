# Naive-Bayes-Python-Implementation
A simple term-frequency naive Bayes implementation in Python. Data is taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection). 
Code only works with the provided data file, but can easily be adapted to work other datasets. 
This is a very rough implementation with lots of room for improvement. 

Text pre-processing is kept to a minimum, but accuracy could potentially improved by removing non alphanumeric characters via regex.
